Linux/OSX with GNU make:
make

Windows:
Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, Visual C++
Prerequisites:
  - OpenSSL 1.0.0d: http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
  - pthreads-Win32: http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/
  - PCRE: http://www.psyon.org/projects/pcre-win32/
  - AMD APP SDK -or- NVIDIA CUDA SDK

Once you have set up these components, edit the following variables
in Makefile.Win32 to reflect the paths where these components were
installed:

OPENSSL_DIR
PTHREADS_DIR
PCRE_DIR
OPENCL_DIR

Note that pthreads and PCRE may be built as static libraries or DLLs.  
The default Makefile.Win32 includes CFLAGS required to link the static
versions of those libraries.  If you want to link against DLLs, make
sure to change the CFLAGS.

Additionally, to create a usable static build of the pthreads-Win32
library, some other changes must be done.  You must edit the Makefile,
and remove "/MD" from the CFLAGS.  Then, build with: "nmake VC-static"

After dependencies have been prepared, open a Visual Studio command
prompt window, and run:

nmake /fMakefile.Win32 vanitygen.exe oclvanitygen.exe


Mac OS X:

Prerequisites:
OpenSSL (0.9.8 is okay, but consider to use 1.0.1 or higher for better performance.)
pcre/pcre++

It's easy to use "homebrew" tool chains for install OpenSSL and pcre/pcre++.
If not installed, take the following steps.

1) Install homebeww
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"

2) Install pcre and openssl
brew install pcre pcre++ openssl
brew link --force openssl

3) Edit ~/.bash_profile to add PATH environment at the end of the file.
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

4) Fetch the source.
git clone https://github.com/7m4gmh/vanitygen.git

5) Build.
cd vanitygen
make -f Makefile all
